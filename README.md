# 9s912_assignments
Repository for students in 9.S912 to submit their homework and project code and slides.

## Instructions
Upload a single folder named `Surname_Firstname` containing two subdirectories: `homework` and `project`.
In `homework` upload neatly all materials for your homework submission; this should include your slides as a PDF and a Jupyter notebook that executes all the code necessary to reproduce your results and figures.
In `project` upload neatly all materials for your final project submission; this will be similar to `homework` but should additionally contain a PDF file of your 2-page final project report.
